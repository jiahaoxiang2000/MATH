# Why This Project?

I am not a mathematician; I am a programmer. However, I often find myself needing to use math in my projects. This project serves as a means for me to learn and practice math, as well as to have a reference for mathematical concepts and formulas. While I have learned some math in the past, my understanding of the subject is not complete. Therefore, I will start from the beginning and progress from there.
