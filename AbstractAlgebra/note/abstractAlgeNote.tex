These abstract algebra notes primarily focus on self-study, with a writing style that deliberately maintains low information density and includes some redundancy for clarity.

My first encounter with abstract algebra was through an English textbook, which was heavily focused on theorem proofs. Progress was slow, and I struggled to see practical applications. After spending considerable time with this approach, I sought Chinese resources for potentially better learning methods. On Bilibili, I discovered Maki's abstract algebra lectures and accompanying notes, which provided an excellent introduction to the subject. However, the content still had some gaps. Later, after finding a recommended algebra book, ``Methods of Algebra" by Professor Li Wenwei, I began compiling these notes based on that foundation to aid my future studies. The ``Methods of Algebra" book is difficult, we math level maybe on the freshman level, so we find the ``Algebra Note" by the Professor Li Wenwei, which is more suitable for us.

% \chapter{Mathematical Tools}

% This appendix covers some of the basic mathematics used in econometrics. We briefly discuss the properties of summation operators, study the properties of linear and some nonlinear equations, and  also introduce some special functions that are common in econometrics applications, including quadratic functions and natural logarithms. The first four sections require only basic algebraic techniques. The fifth section briefly reviews differential Calculus Although Calculus is not necessary to understand much of this book, it is used in some of the end-of-chapter appendices and in some of the more advanced topics in part 3.

% \section{Summation Operator and Description Statistics}

% \textbf{Summation Operator} is an abbreviation used to express the summation of numbers, it plays an important role in statistics and econometrics analysis. If $\{x_i: i=1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is a sequence of $n$ numbers, the summation of the $n$ numbers is:
