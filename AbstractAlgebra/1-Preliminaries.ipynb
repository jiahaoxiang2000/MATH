    "- A theorem cannot be proved by example; however, the standard way to show that a\n",
    "statement is not a theorem is to provide a counterexample.\n",
    "- Quantifiers are important. Words and phrases such as *only, for all, for every,* and for *some* possess different meanings.\n",
    "- Never assume any hypothesis that is not explicitly stated in the theorem. You cannot\n",
    "take things for granted.\n",
    "- Suppose you wish to show that an object exists and is unique. First show that there\n",
    "actually is such an object. To show that it is unique, assume that there are two such\n",
    "objects, say $r$ and $s$, and then show that $r$ = $s$.\n",
    "- Sometimes it is easier to prove the contrapositive of a statement. Proving the statement “If $p$, then $q$” is exactly the same as proving the statement “If not $q$, then not $p$.”\n",
    "- Although it is usually better to find a direct proof of a theorem, this task can sometimes be difficult. It may be easier to assume that the theorem that you are trying\n",
    "to prove is false, and to hope that in the course of your argument you are forced to\n",
    "make some statement that cannot possibly be true."
