    "Uncoded messages may be composed of letters or characters, but typically they consist of binary $m$-tuples. These messages are encoded into codewords consisting of binary $n$-tuples, by a device called an **encoder**. The message is transmitted and then decoded. We will consider the occurrence of errors during transmission. An error occurs if there is a change in one or more bits in the codeword. A **decoding** scheme is a method that either converts an arbitrarily received $n$-tuple into a meaningful decoded message or gives an error message for that $n$-tuple."

The received word is a codeword, but will be decoded into a $C$ instead of an $A$. Second, we do not have the ability to **correct errors**. If the 8-tuple $(\\text{1001 1000})$ is received, we know that an error has occurred, but we have no idea which bit has been changed."
