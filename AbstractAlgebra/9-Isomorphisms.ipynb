    "Many groups may appear to be different at first glance, but can be shown to be the same by a simple renaming of the group elements. For example, $ \\mathbb{Z}_4 $ and the subgroup of the circle group $ \\mathbb{T} $ generated by $ i $ can be shown to be the same by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two groups and between the group operations. In such a case, we say that the groups are **isomorphic**."
